# Campus Service

Campus Service is a production-oriented Intelligent Smart Campus Platform. It is being prepared as a Java backend that gives university operations a consistent, secure foundation rather than a collection of disconnected systems.

## Problem Statement

University operations commonly span separate processes for identity, academic records, accommodation, finance, communications, and reporting. Campus Service aims to provide a coherent backend platform for those capabilities while preserving clear domain ownership and operational reliability.

## Product Vision

Build an extensible, maintainable platform that can support campus operations today and workflow and AI-assisted capabilities later, without introducing distributed-system complexity before it is justified.

## Initial Scope

Phase 1A provides the backend bootstrap: Maven, Java 21, PostgreSQL integration, Flyway, Actuator health, and Testcontainers integration tests. Identity and Access, user and role management, authentication, authorization, and all business-domain modules remain out of scope.

## Domain Roadmap

**Core domains**

- Identity and Access
- Student
- Faculty and Staff
- Academic
- Dormitory
- Finance

**Supporting domains**

- Library
- Event
- Notification
- Audit
- Reporting and Analytics

**Advanced future domains**

- Workflow Automation
- AI Assistant
- RAG
- GraphRAG

## Technology Baseline

The initial backend uses the following baseline. Dependency versions are managed by Spring Boot unless stated otherwise.

- Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.5.16
- Maven
- PostgreSQL, Spring Data JPA, and Flyway
- Spring Security with JWT-based authentication
- Bean Validation
- OpenAPI/Swagger
- JUnit 5, Mockito, Spring Boot Test, and Testcontainers
- Docker and Docker Compose for local infrastructure

Redis is not a baseline dependency. It will be introduced only for a concrete caching, token, rate-limiting, or temporary-data requirement.

## Architecture

Campus Service will begin as a modular monolith: one deployable application with explicit module boundaries and controlled dependencies. This keeps the first release straightforward to develop and operate while allowing proven modules to be extracted later if required. See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) and [ADR 0001](docs/decisions/0001-modular-monolith-first.md).

## Status

**Phase 1B: Identity and Access.** Identity persistence, JWT authentication, and administrator user-management endpoints are implemented. Administrator endpoints require `ROLE_ADMIN`; create, list, get, status change, role replacement, and password reset are available under `/api/v1/admin/users`. Production deployment capability remains out of scope.

## Planned Phases

1. Phase 0: product scope, architecture baseline, conventions, test strategy, ADRs, and agent rules.
2. Phase 1: Spring Boot bootstrap, shared kernel, Identity and Access, PostgreSQL, Flyway, and authentication/authorization tests.
3. Later: Student and Faculty; Academic; Dormitory and Finance; supporting modules; observability and deployment; workflow and AI capabilities.

## Documentation Map

- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md): system boundaries and technical direction.
- [Development](docs/development.md): local workflow and repository conventions.
- [Testing](docs/testing.md): test strategy and evidence expectations.
- [Architecture Decision Records](docs/decisions/README.md): durable technical decisions.
- [Agent Instructions](AGENTS.md): concise operating rules for coding agents.

The verified Windows build command is:

```powershell
.\mvnw.cmd clean verify
```

It compiles with Java 21 and runs PostgreSQL Testcontainers integration tests. The Docker Compose configuration was created for local development but was not started during this change.
